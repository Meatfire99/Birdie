# Single Token Farming

Single Token Farming offers a token deposit function akin to that of first-generation Yield Farming Aggregators for individual tokens.

1. The user selects a pool from the Pool List, enters the amount of the token to be deposited, and clicks the “Start Farming” button provided by Birdie.
2. The connected wallet will prompt the user to review and approve the transaction. Upon confirmation, the token is deposited into the corresponding protocol’s pool via the Single Token Vault of the Liquidity Module, and receipt tokens are issued.
3. These receipt tokens are then automatically stored in the designated vault to facilitate ongoing farming and harvesting, with equivalent Birdie receipt tokens being issued to the user.
4. From that point on, Birdie farms on the basis of the receipt token ownership, allowing the user to enjoy the benefits of compounded yields.

To withdraw tokens after farming, the user clicks “Stop Farming” and approves the reverse process via their wallet, thereby receiving their tokens back in the proper sequence.
