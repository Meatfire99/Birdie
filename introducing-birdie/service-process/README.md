# Service Process

Birdie supports three primary functions: Single Token Farming, Pair Token Farming, and Swap.&#x20;

The following outlines how each process operates. Although nearly all processes within Birdie are automated—so that users need not understand the underlying mechanics—this explanation will be helpful for those wishing to gain a deeper understanding of the service.

For users primarily interested in how to operate the service rather than its technical details, please refer to the “How to Use Birdie” section available in the menu.
