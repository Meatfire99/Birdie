# Point System

Birdie awards points to users who engage in swap transactions through its service.

When a swap is executed, a portion of the trading fee income accumulates in the relevant pool. Once the yield surpasses the predefined threshold, an automatic harvest is triggered, and the resulting yield is distributed to users in the form of Birdie Points.

These points are allocated to users based on their proportional share of the total trading volume between consecutive harvests, multiplied by a preset factor for clarity. For example, if the harvested yield is 0.1 ETH and the total trading volume between harvests is 100 ETH, and if the preset multiplier is 1,000, then each 1 ETH of trading volume would earn 1 Point (calculated as 0.001 multiplied by 1,000).

Birdie Points are issued for operational purposes and can be viewed by connecting oneâ€™s wallet to the Birdie service. While the Points may later be used in leaderboards, events, or to grant special benefits, no definitive plans have been finalized as of yet.
