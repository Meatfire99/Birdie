# Birdie Index

The Birdie Index represents the dollar-equivalent value of a single Birdie receipt token issued upon completing the liquidity supply process for a specific pool on Birdie.

For example, if the total value of tokens deposited into a WBTC/WETH pool is $100,000,000 and 10,000 receipt tokens have been issued, the Birdie Index for that pool would be 10,000.

The Birdie Index is provided to help users better understand their investment, assess the value of their deposited assets, and monitor changes in the poolâ€™s overall value.

Much like stock market pricing enables an investor to determine how many shares they own based on the investment amount and share price, the Birdie Index allows users to quickly discern the number of receipt tokens they will obtain for a given investment. Moreover, by multiplying the Birdie Index with the number of receipt tokens held, users can readily determine the total value of assets supplied to a pool. Comparing the Birdie Index at the time of deposit with its current value further enables users to gauge the performance of their investment over time.
