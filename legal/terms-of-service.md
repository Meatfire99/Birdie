# Terms of Service

\*\*Notice\*\* **Birdie Services are not available to residents, citizens, or entities registered in the United States or any U.S.-sanctioned jurisdictions.** It is the user's sole responsibility to determine their legal eligibility to access our Services. We may implement technical measures such as IP blocking and wallet screening to enforce this restriction, but such measures are not exhaustive. If we determine, at our sole discretion, that a user has circumvented these restrictions, we reserve the right to terminate access to our Services without prior notice and report such activity to relevant regulatory authorities as required by law. We may implement technical measures, such as IP blocking, to enforce this restriction. However, it is the user’s responsibility to know whether these laws are applicable to themselves before engaging with the Birdie website.

&#x20;

### 1. Welcome to Birdie.center and the Interface!



These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of both the Birdie.center website (the "Website") and the interface, which consists of a group of websites: Birdie.farm, Birdie.exchange, Birdie.finance, Birdie.fund, and Birdie.money (referred to as the "Interface") collectively referred to as the "Services." The Services are brought to you by the Birdie Labs ("we," "us," or "our").

**Birdie.center** provides information about the Birdie Protocol, a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol based on open-source self-executing smart contracts deployed on various permissionless blockchains, including Ethereum. The Birdie Labs does not control or operate any version of the Birdie Protocol on any blockchain network.

&#x20;

**The Interface** is an independent application that allows users to interact with the Birdie Protocol using their self-custodial wallets.

&#x20;

**Arbitration notice:** These terms contain an arbitration clause below. Except for certain types of disputes mentioned in that arbitration clause, you and we agree that any disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Services shall be settled by final and binding arbitration under the rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR). The seat of arbitration shall be the Republic of Korea. The arbitration shall be conducted in either Korean or English, at the claimant's discretion. If applicable law prohibits mandatory arbitration, users may have the right to seek redress in their local jurisdiction. The parties agree to waive any right to a class-action lawsuit, except where such a waiver is expressly prohibited by law. Users further waive the right to participate in any class-action lawsuit unless otherwise required by applicable law.

&#x20;

**By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms**



By accessing or using our Services—including Birdie.center, its subdomains, applications, and other linked services—you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy (found here), and all referenced policies (collectively, the 'Agreement').

In case of any conflict between these Terms and additional applicable terms, these Terms shall prevail unless explicitly stated otherwise. If you do not agree with these Terms, you may not use the Services and should not visit the Site or otherwise engage with the Services.



**Use of the Services**

To access the Services, you must have the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet the eligibility requirement. If you do not meet the requirement, you must not access or use the Site or the Services.



**We may modify the Services and these Terms**

We may change or update the Services, the Agreement, and any part of the Terms at any time, for any reason, at our sole discretion. Once any part of the Agreement is updated and in effect, you will be bound by the Terms if you continue to use the Services. We reserve the right to modify or terminate any part of the Services at any time, without liability to you, including access through third-party links.

The information provided on the Website is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment, financial, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, or similar advice. Website content must not be construed as such.

Further, nothing on this Website should be construed as a recommendation, by Birdie Labs, affiliates, or any third party, to acquire or dispose of any investment, or to engage in any investment strategy or transaction. You should consult your own investment, legal, tax and/or similar professionals regarding your specific situation and any specific decisions.



### 2. Services



Birdie.center is an informational resource about the Protocol; however, it is not the exclusive or sole source.

All information provided in connection with your access and use of the Services is intended for informational purposes only. While we strive to provide accurate and reliable information, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information provided. It is possible that the information may be outdated or subject to errors or omissions. The codebases of all the versions of the Birdie Protocol are maintained on each full network node of the relevant blockchain. You should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained on Birdie.center, including, without limitation, the docs.birdie.center ("Developer Docs") or any other information that we make available at any time, including blog posts, data, articles, links to third-party content, Discord content, news feeds, tutorials, tweets, and videos. You further acknowledge and agree that we will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such site or resource.

Users retain full control over their cryptoassets at all times. However, we reserve the right to restrict access to our platform and Services if illegal activity is suspected. This restriction does not impact users' ability to manage their cryptoassets via other means outside our platform.

&#x20;

Neither we nor any affiliated entity is a party to any transaction on the blockchain networks underlying the Birdie Protocol; we do not have possession, custody or control over any cryptoassets, or any user's funds. You understand that when you interact with Birdie Protocol, you retain control over your cryptoassets at all times.

Users interact with the Birdie Protocol through third-party self-custodial wallets, over which we have no control or responsibility.

&#x20;

To interact with the Birdie Protocol using the Interface, you will need to connect and engage with it through your self-custodial wallet. It is important to note that your self-custodial wallet is provided by a third-party entity and is generally governed by separate terms and conditions set by the respective third-party service provider. These terms and conditions may involve additional fees, disclaimers, or risk warnings regarding the accuracy and reliance on the provided information. Reviewing and comprehending the terms and conditions associated with your chosen self-custodial wallet provider to ensure compliance and to be aware of any applicable charges or risks is your sole responsibility.



**We do not serve as intermediaries for transactions on the Birdie Protocol**

&#x20;Due to the non-custodial and decentralized nature of the technology, we are not intermediaries, agents, advisors, or custodians, and we do not have a fiduciary relationship or obligation to you regarding any other decisions or activities that you affect when using our Services.



**We have no information about all Protocol transactions beyond what is publicly available via the blockchain**

&#x20;You acknowledge that we do not have information regarding all Birdie Protocol transactions beyond what is available or obtainable publicly via the blockchain. However, we may collect information regarding the users of the Services in accordance with our Privacy Policy.



**Transactions conducted on the blockchain may be subject to fees**

&#x20;Transactions using blockchains may require the payment of gas fees, which are essentially network transaction fees paid on every transaction that occurs on the selected blockchain network. Please note that gas fees are non-refundable. We do not provide any services to users or deliver, hold, and/or receive payment for cryptoassets. We do not receive any fees for any transactions or the Services.



### 3. Assumption of Risk

**You assume the risks of engaging in novel and experimental technology**

Technologies such as smart contracts on various blockchains, cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications, and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these technologies and even result in a total loss of cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds. While we strive to maintain a secure and operational interface, you acknowledge and accept that blockchain-based services are inherently risky. We assume no liability for smart contract vulnerabilities, cyberattacks, third-party service failures, or any losses arising from technological or market risks. However, we commit to implementing industry-standard security measures to mitigate such risks where commercially reasonable. This clause shall not exclude liability for gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct on our part. If you are not comfortable assuming these risks, you should not access or engage in transactions using blockchain-based technology.



**We are not liable for any third-party services or links**

We are not responsible for the content or services of any third-parties, including, without limitation, any network or apps like Discord or MetaMask, and we make no representations regarding the content or accuracy of any third-party services or materials. The use and access of any third-party products or services, including through the Services, are at your own risk. Please note that we do not have control over third-party services. Consequently, we cannot guarantee, endorse, or recommend such content or services to users of the Interface, nor can we endorse their use for any specific purpose.



**You agree that proceeds will be automatically collected and disbursed by smart contracts**

You acknowledge that all blockchain transactions are executed automatically through smart contracts. By engaging in transactions using the Services, you acknowledge and consent to the automatic processing of all transactions in connection with using the Services. You further acknowledge and agree that the applicable smart contract will dictate how the funds of a transaction and ownership of cryptoassets are distributed.



**You acknowledge the risks of using the Services**

You bear sole responsibility for evaluating the Services before using them, and all transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, final, and without refunds. The Services may be disabled, disrupted, or adversely impacted as a result of sophisticated cyber-attacks, surges in activity, computer viruses, and/or other operational or technical challenges, among other things. We do not have an ongoing obligation to notify you of all potential risks associated with using and accessing our Services. You agree to accept these risks and agree that you will not seek to hold any Birdie Labs Indemnified Party responsible for any consequent losses.



**You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your self-custodial wallet**

You acknowledge and accept full responsibility for securing your self-custodial wallet.  You alone are responsible for securing your private keys. We do not have access to your private keys. Any unauthorized access to your self-custodial wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of any cryptoasset or funds held in your account and any associated accounts. You understand and agree that we have no involvement in, and you will not hold us responsible for managing and maintaining the security of your self-custodial wallet. The private key linked to your self-custodial wallet is the only key that can control the cryptoassets you transfer into smart contracts.



**We reserve the right to restrict your access from engaging with the Services**

You agree that we have the right to restrict your access to the Services using any technically feasible methods if we suspect, at our sole discretion, that

(a)  you are using the Services for money laundering or any illegal activity;

(b)  you have engaged in fraudulent activity;

(c)  you have acquired cryptoassets using inappropriate methods, including the use of stolen funds to purchase such assets;

(d)  you are the target of any sanctions administered or enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, Her Majesty’s Treasury, or any other legal or regulatory authority in any applicable jurisdiction;

(e)  either you, as an individual or an entity, or your wallet address is listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (“SDN List”), Consolidated Sanctions List (“Non-SDN Lists), or any other sanctions lists administered by OFAC;

(f)  you are located, organized, or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the subject of sanctions, including but not limited to Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Belarus, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria; or

(g)  you have otherwise acted in violation of these Terms.

If we reasonably suspect that you are using the Services for illegal activities, we reserve the right to take appropriate action.



**We do not guarantee the quality or availability of the Services**

As a condition to accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge, understand, and agree that from time to time, the Services may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, but not limited to equipment malfunctions, periodic maintenance procedures or repairs, causes beyond our control or that we could not reasonably foresee, disruptions and temporary or permanent unavailability of underlying blockchain infrastructure or unavailability of third-party service providers or external partners for any reason.



**You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Services at your own risk.**

You should not engage in blockchain-based transactions unless it is suitable given your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence into the risks of a transaction and the underlying smart contracts and cryptoassets.

By interacting with the website and/or publicly deployed smart contracts, the user acknowledges the experimental and high-risk nature of yield farming, the Service’s dependency on third-party protocols, and the potential for a total loss of funds deposited by the user. The user accepts full liability for their usage of the Website, and no financial responsibility is placed on the Birdie Labs, Birdie Labs Indemnified Party or any 3rd parties engaged by the website, Birdie Labs and/or Birdie Labs Indemnified Party .

The utilization of cryptocurrencies involves a high degree of risk and can lead to the total loss of assets. The information published on the website cannot and does not guarantee any return on the placement of assets, and/or that amounts invested will not be lost. Information regarding rates of return, % performance such as APY, and other information displayed on the website is for educational purposes only, and serves as an informal guide to the user on interaction with public blockchain smart contracts.



**\*\*Important\*\*:** The stated AP\[\[R]/\[Y]] (the 'Rate') is denominated in terms of \[RELEVANT TOKEN], not USD or other fiat currency. The Rate is a forward-looking projection based on good faith belief of how to reasonably project results over the relevant period. However, the projected rate (APY) is not a guaranteed return and is subject to significant risks, including but not limited to, changes in market conditions, smart contract vulnerabilities, and fluctuations in token value. Users should conduct independent research and seek professional financial advice before making any investment decisions. Also, such belief is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties (including smart contract security risks and third-party actions) which could result in a materially different (lower or higher) token-denominated AP\[\[R]/\[Y]]. The Rate is not a promise, guarantee or undertaking on the part of any person or group of persons, but depends entirely on the results of the operation of smart contracts and other autonomous systems (including third-party systems) and how third parties interact with those systems after the time of your deposit. Even if the Rate is achieved as projected, you may still suffer a financial loss in fiat-denominated terms if the fiat-denominated value of the relevant tokens (your deposit and any tokens allocated or distributed to you pursuant to the Rate) declines during the deposit period.



### 4. Taxes



**You are responsible for your taxes and duties**

Users are solely responsible for determining, reporting, and paying any applicable taxes, duties, or governmental fees related to their use of the Services. Birdie Labs does not provide tax advice, nor does it collect, report, or remit taxes on behalf of users unless required by applicable law. Users should consult a qualified tax professional to ensure compliance with their local tax regulations. Blockchain-based transactions are novel, and their tax treatment is uncertain.



### 5. Ownership



**We grant you a license to use our Services**

Contingent upon your ongoing compliance with the Agreement, we grant you a personal, worldwide, revocable, non-exclusive, and non-assignable license to use the software provided to you as part of our Services. The only purpose of this license is to allow you to use and enjoy the Services solely as permitted by these Terms.



**We own all rights in the Services**

We own any and all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including, without limitation, any and all copyrights in and to any content, code, data, or other materials that you may access or use on or through the Services. Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of or access to the Services does not grant you any ownership or other rights therein.



**We may use and share your feedback**

Any comments, bug reports, ideas, or other feedback that you may provide about our Services, including suggestions about how we might improve our Services, are entirely voluntary. You agree that we are free to use or not use any feedback that we receive from you as we see fit, including copying and sharing such feedback with third parties, without any obligation to you.

(j)  Engaging in any anticompetitive behavior or other misconduct.



**Violating our rules may result in our intervention**

You acknowledge that using the Services to engage in prohibited conduct may result in access restrictions, we permanently reserve the right to completely or partially restrict or revoke your access to the Services, either completely or for a period of time, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to amend, rectify, edit, or otherwise alter transaction data to remediate or mitigate any damage caused either to us or to any other person as a result of a user’s violation of this Agreement or applicable law.



**We reserve the right to investigate violations**

We reserve the right to investigate and prosecute any suspected breaches of this Agreement, including the Terms. We may disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.



### 7. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability



**We make no representations or warranties**

The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We and our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the "Birdie Labs indemnified party") make no guarantees of any kind in connection with the Services. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Birdie Labs indemnified party disclaim all warranties and conditions, whether express or implied, of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement and disclaim all responsibility and liability for:

(a)  The Services being accurate, complete, current, reliable, uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free. Information (including, without limitation, the value or outcome of any transaction) available through the service is provided for general information only and should not be relied upon or used as the sole basis for making decisions. Any reliance on the Services is at your own risk.

(b)  Injury or damage resulting from the Services. For example, you expressly acknowledge, understand, and agree that the Services may contain audio-visual effects, strobe lights, or other materials that may affect your physical senses and/or physical condition. Further, you expressly acknowledge that the Birdie Labs indemnified party are not responsible for loss or damage caused by another user's conduct, unauthorized actors, or any unauthorized access to or use of the Services.

(c)  Viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs, cancel bots, spiders, malware, or other types of malicious code that may be used in any way to affect the functionality or operation of the Services.



**Limitation of Liability**

To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall any Birdie Labs indemnified party be liable to you for any loss, damage, or injury of any kind, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, consequential, or punitive losses or damages, or damages for system failure or malfunction or loss of profits, data, use, business, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with:

(a)  The Services or your inability to use or access the Services.

(b)  Misuse of the Services (including, without limitation, unauthorized access of the Services).

(c)  Any user conduct on the Services.

(d)  Termination, suspension, or restriction of access to any of the Services.

However, this limitation of liability does not apply in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud on our part, or where such limitation is prohibited by applicable law.

In addition to the foregoing, no Birdie Labs indemnified party shall be liable for any damages caused in whole or in part by:

(a)  User error, such as forgotten passwords or incorrectly constructed smart contracts or other transactions.

(b)  Server failure or data loss.

(c)  The malfunction, unexpected function, or unintended function of the blockchain, any computer or cryptoasset network (including any wallet provider), including, without limitation, losses associated with network forks, replay attacks, double-spend attacks, sybil attacks, 51% attacks, governance disputes, mining difficulty, changes in cryptography or consensus rules, hacking, or cybersecurity breaches.

(d)  Any change in value of any cryptoasset.

(e)  Any change in law, regulation, or policy.

(f)  Events of force majeure.

(g)  Any third party.



This limitation of liability is intended to apply without regard to whether other provisions of these terms have been breached or have proven ineffective. The limitations set forth in this section shall apply regardless of the form of action, whether the asserted liability or damages are based on contract, indemnification, tort, strict liability, statute, or any other legal or equitable theory, and whether or not the Birdie Labs indemnified party have been informed of the possibility of any such damage.

In no event will the Birdie Labs indemnified party's cumulative liability to you or any other user, from all causes of action and all theories of liability, exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (U.S. $1,000.00).

Under no circumstances shall any Birdie Labs Indemnified Party be required to deliver to you any virtual currency as damages, perform specific obligations, or provide any other remedy. We assume no liability for any loss of cryptoassets. In the event of a legal claim where damages are considered, any calculations based on virtual currency values shall use the lowest value during the specified period. However, this does not constitute a guarantee or obligation for compensation.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties and liabilities provided in this section; accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent applicable law does not permit Birdie Labs Indemnified Party to disclaim certain warranties or limit certain liabilities, the extent of Birdie Labs Indemnified Party’s liability and the scope of any such warranties will be as permitted under applicable law.

### 10. Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Rights, Including Class Actions



Please read this section carefully: It may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court and to have a jury hear your claims. It contains procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and a class action waiver.



**Agreement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes Through Good Faith Negotiations**

&#x20;Prior to commencing any legal proceeding against us of any kind, including an arbitration as set forth below, you and we agree that we will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between us arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the Services (each, a “Dispute” and, collectively, “Disputes”) by engaging in good faith negotiations. Such good faith negotiations require, at a minimum, that the aggrieved party provide a written notice to the other party specifying the nature and details of the Dispute. The party receiving such notice shall have thirty (30) days to respond to the notice. Within sixty (60) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial notice, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith by videoconference, or by telephone, to try to resolve the Dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within ninety (90) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial notice, the parties may agree to mediate their Dispute, or either party may submit the Dispute to arbitration as set forth below.



**Agreement to Arbitrate**

You and we agree that any Dispute that cannot be resolved through the procedures set forth above will be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution. The place of arbitration shall be the Republic of Korea. The language of the arbitration shall be in Korean. The arbitrator(s) shall have experience adjudicating matters involving Internet technology, software applications, financial transactions and, ideally, blockchain technology. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the 'Limitation of Liability' section of these Terms regarding the types and amounts of damages a party may be held liable for. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor its representatives may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of (all/both) parties.

Unless you timely provide us with an arbitration opt-out notice (as defined below in the subsection titled “Your Choices”), you acknowledge and agree that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and we otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

&#x20;

**Changes**

By rejecting any changes to these Terms, you agree that you will arbitrate any Dispute based on the version of these Terms you originally accepted.



### 11. Waiver of Injunctive or Other Equitable Relief



To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not be permitted to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief of any kind, such as any court or other action that may interfere with or prevent the development or exploitation of the Services, or any other website, application, content, submission, product, service, or intellectual property owned, licensed, used, or controlled by any Birdie Labs indemnified party.



### 12. Termination; Cancellation



This Agreement is effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate your Agreement with us at any time by ceasing all access to the Services. If, in our sole judgment, you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of the Agreement (including without limitation any provision of these Terms), we reserve the right to terminate our Agreement with you and deny you access to the Services. We further reserve the right to restrict your access to the Services or to stop providing you with all or a part of the Services at any time and for no reason, including, without limitation, if we reasonably believe:

(a)  your use of the Services exposes us to risk or liability;

(b)  you are using the Services for unlawful purposes; or

(c)  it is not commercially viable to continue providing you with our Services.

All of these are in addition to any other rights and remedies that may be available to us, whether in equity or at law, all of which we expressly reserve.

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue any portion of the Services at our sole discretion. In the event of service termination, we will provide at least fifthteen (15) days’ notice where possible. Users will be given access to their funds through alternative methods if available. However, we are not responsible for external blockchain network failures or force majeure events that may impact users' ability to retrieve their assets. In the event of termination, we will provide users with reasonable prior notice (at least 15 days where possible) and offer a mechanism for users to retrieve their assets before service discontinuation. However, we are not responsible for losses incurred due to force majeure events or regulatory actions beyond our control. You agree that we may remove the Services and/or any content thereon for indefinite periods of time or cancel the Services at any time, without notice to you.



### 13. Severability



If any provision of the Agreement (including without limitation these Terms) is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from the Agreement. Such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.



### 14. Assignment



The Agreement (including, without limitation, these Terms) may be assigned without your prior consent to any Birdie Labs Indemnified Party, or to its successors in the interest of any business associated with the Services provided by us. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under the Agreement without our prior written consent.



### 15. Entire Agreement



The Agreement (including, without limitation, these Terms, and the Privacy Policy) and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services constitute the entire Agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior or contemporaneous Agreements, communications, and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of these Terms). Any failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement (including, without limitation, these Terms) shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.



### 16. Governing Law



These Terms and any separate agreements under which we provide services to you shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Korea.
