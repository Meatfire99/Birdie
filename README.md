# Welcome to Birdie

Welcome to Birdie.

Birdie is an innovative software tool designed within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem **to enable users to earn “interest income” and “trading fee income”** **SIMULTANEOUSLY** by utilizing their cryptocurrencies. Whereas traditional DeFi platforms typically allow users to benefit from only one of these two principal yield models—either interest or fees—Birdie empowers you to continuously enjoy both streams of income with just a single liquidity provision.

We invite you to join Birdie and embrace a smarter approach to yield farming.







### Disclaimer
